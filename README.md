# Numerical Methods
This project includes my attempts of a Numerical Methods class, where we solve interesting problems in quantitative finance.

## Table of Contents
* `hw0`
   - Brownian Motion - calculation and simulation
* `hw1`
   - Trinomial Tree - pricing of an up-and-out put, an up-and-in put, and a continuously-monitored barrier option
   - Implied Volatility (IV) - calculation of time-0 IV under the Black-Scholes model, pricing an option by expiry interpolation
* `hw2`
   - Trinomial Tree - pricing of an American put using local volatility model, compound option
   - Greeks - Taylor approximation of delta of an at-the-money call; Taylor expansion of the call price in terms of dollar delta and dollar gamma
1. Trees
2. Finite Differences
3. Monte Carlo
4. Fourier Transform

If time permits:
5. Parameter calibration/fitting
6. Reinforcement Learning for optimal option exercise
